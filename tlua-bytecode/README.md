# tlua-bytecode
This crate contains the bytecode for the tlua vm and implements limited evaluation of expressions
generated by the `tlua-parser` trait. It is _not_ a general interpreter.

# Instability Guarantee
This crate is effectively permanently unstable. It will be changed as required to suit the needs of
the main tlua crate. No consideration will be given to dependents of this crate.
