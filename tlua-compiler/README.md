# tlua-compiler
This crate contains the bytecode compiler for the tlua vm. Its output is consumed by the tlua runtime.

# Instability Guarantee
This crate is effectively permanently unstable. It will be changed as required to suit the needs of
the main tlua crate. No consideration will be given to dependents of this crate.
